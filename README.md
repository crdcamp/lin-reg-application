# My First Official Linear Regression Application

This repository contains a final sequence of linear regression lessons using a [Harvard resource](https://harvard-iacs.github.io/2018-CS109A/pages/schedule.html) as reference. This final sequence of learning will then be used for my own application within this repository. Completion of these requirements marks a massive milestone in my ML learning journey. Once this project is complete, it will then be time to move onto classification.

In other words, this is likely my most important repository to date, and serves as a demonstration of my newfound knowledge.
